# 🧬 Ocean-to-Land Evolution Simulator

An immersive evolutionary simulation that recreates life's epic 3.5 billion year journey from primordial oceans to terrestrial ecosystems. Watch digital organisms evolve the adaptations needed to colonize land in real-time!

> *"From the first replicating molecules in Earth's ancient seas to the first steps onto dry land - witness evolution in action."*

## 🌊 The Journey

This simulation models one of biology's greatest transitions: **the colonization of land by life from the ocean**. Starting with simple organisms in a primordial soup, watch as evolution gradually develops the key innovations that made terrestrial life possible.

### Evolutionary Stages

- **🦠 Primordial**: Basic life forms in the deep ocean, feeding on chemicals from thermal vents
- **🌊 Tidal**: Organisms developing tolerance for shallow waters and air exposure  
- **🐸 Amphibious**: Transitional forms capable of limited land exploration
- **🌿 Terrestrial**: Fully land-adapted life with photosynthesis and terrestrial mobility

## 🎮 Features

### Advanced Organism Evolution
- **Chemical Metabolism**: Organisms feed on methane, sulfur, ammonia, or organic matter
- **Land Adaptation Traits**:
  - Air Breathing (0.0 → 1.0): Water-only → Full air breathing
  - Land Mobility (0.0 → 1.0): Aquatic → Terrestrial movement
  - Desiccation Resistance (0.0 → 1.0): Dies on land → Survives drying
  - Photosynthesis (0.0 → 1.0): Chemical feeding → Solar energy

### 3D Ocean Environment  
- **Thermal Vents**: Deep ocean zones rich in sulfur and methane
- **Chemical Gradients**: Realistic distribution of nutrients by depth
- **Tidal Zones**: Transition areas where air-breathing evolves
- **Land Areas**: Terrestrial zones requiring full land adaptations

### Real-Time Evolution Tracking
- Population distribution across evolutionary stages
- Average trait development over time
- Land colonization progress
- Milestone announcements for major evolutionary breakthroughs

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ 
- Terminal/Command Prompt

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gh0st-La6z-exe/evo_ecoJT.git
   cd evo_ecoJT
   ```

2. **Run the simulation**:
   ```bash
   python evo_eco.py
   ```

3. **Watch evolution unfold**:
   - Organisms start as simple primordial life in the ocean
   - Over time, they develop air breathing, land mobility, and other adaptations
   - Eventually, some will colonize land and develop photosynthesis
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the simulation

## 🧪 Scientific Accuracy

The simulation incorporates real evolutionary principles:

- **Gradual Evolution**: Traits develop slowly through small mutations
- **Selection Pressure**: Land poses survival challenges requiring specific adaptations
- **Chemical Environments**: Realistic ocean chemistry with thermal vents
- **Metabolic Constraints**: Energy costs drive evolutionary trade-offs
- **Population Dynamics**: Birth/death cycles maintain evolutionary pressure
